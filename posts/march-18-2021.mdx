The United States plans to send 4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to Mexico and Canada, marking the first time in history the U.S. has directly supplied another country with vaccines.

The coronavirus pandemic has made us all adapt and struggle in our own way, but it has united us over a common struggle, giving me hope that we will get through this.
