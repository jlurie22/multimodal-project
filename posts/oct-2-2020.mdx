An outbreak of COVID-19 took place in the White House in early October. On October 2nd, President Trump tested positive for the coronavirus, followed by several aides and the press secretary over the next few days.

While famous actors and public figures had tested positive prior, an outbreak in the White House instilled in me that nobody is above contracting the coronavirus.
