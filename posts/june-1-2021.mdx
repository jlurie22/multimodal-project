The Delta Variant, believed to originate in India, spread rapidly across the United States during the summer of 2021, eventually leading to reinstituting mask policies in high risk areas in late July.

Unlike before, with the safety measures my family, friends and I took, it seemed unrealistic for us to contract COVID-19. Between the Delta Variant spreading rapidly and living in a new college environment, it was clear that my friends and I, along with most college students, were likely to be exposed to the virus. After a couple of my friends tested positive in mid August, I tested negative and was once again lulled into the unrealistic belief that I was in the clear, only to test positive myself on September 1st.

Although quarantines and isolation were not new to me, coming from New York City, it was certainly a change to be removed from my room and isolated in a hotel. I was lucky enough to spend this time with my roommate, who tested positive as well, but it was still a mental challenge to locked inside without even being able to take a quiet walk for an extended period of time.
