The CDC announces an expanded list of people at risk for severe illness from COVID-19, noting that risk increases with age, as well as those with certain diseases or compromised immune systems.

As we learned more about the virus, I started to think about the people I would be putting at risk, realizing that I did not know when I would see my grandparents or some of my friends again.
