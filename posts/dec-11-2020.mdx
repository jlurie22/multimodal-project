The FDA issues Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer's BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, the first vaccine approved to combat the coronavirus. The vaccine is recommended for people 16 years or older.

This presented a light at the end of the tunnel. Despite doubts from the doctors I know, I believed that  a vaccine, no matter how affective, was a big step forward in the fight against COVID-19.
